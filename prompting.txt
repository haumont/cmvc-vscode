Create a VSCode extension project.  Make a VSCode source control extension.  The interface should look like the GIT source control built into VSCode.  In the first section of the primary side bar, there should be a text field to set a value called "Family" which is used throughout the extension commands, another called "Release", and other called "Defect".  These should be at the top of the Primary status bar when the extension is selected as active via the buttons on the primary status bar.  Below this should be a file explorer view in. a second section showing all the files in the current folder directory and below, and the files should be write clickable with three commands for now: Checkin, Checkout, and View. 

Checkin should call the command line to do a "File -checkin <filename> -defect <Defect> -release <Release> -family <Family>". Checkout should be similar except replacing "-checkin" with "checkout".  The file view will not be updated when these commands are called.  The View command should pop up a new editor tab with the output of the "File -view <filename> -release <Release> -family <Family>" command.

Below this should be a third section for the Track view.  This should be empty right now, but say have the text "Track support in the future"
